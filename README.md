# 🌊 Geographic Information Systems Calculator

## Current Progress:

🔹 Developed a Python script that takes as input the paths to an arbitrary raster (GeoTIFF) and vector polygon (Shapefile, GeoJSON or KML) and return the average value of cells within the bounds of the polygon.<br>
🔹 A raster file of a Landsat8 scene for Band 5 (NIR) were demoed.<br>
🔹 Explored the raster file data and metadata - understanding what transformations might be required during the task.<br>

## Next Steps: 

This tool will use geospatial analysis to identify locations for sustainable material recovery, optimal routes for collection, and the best sites for new recycling infrastructure determining:

🔹 Where are critical minerals in high abundance?<br>
🔹 What are the most efficient way to reclaim them at scale?<br>
🔹 Include a Dockerfile and some sample inputs files for demos

💡 Ideal outcome: Build a mapping tool that visualizes locations to support circular economy planning with infrastructure siting and geospatial insights.
