# 🌊 Geographic Information Systems Calculator

## Current Progress:

🔹 Developed Python script that takes as input the paths to an arbitrary raster (GeoTIFF) and vector polygon (Shapefile, GeoJSON or KML)<br>
🔹 Returns the average value of cells within the bounds of the polygon<br>
🔹 Raster file of a Landsat8 scene for Band 5 (NIR) were demoed<br>
🔹 Explored raster file data and metadata - understanding what transformations might be required during the task<br>


<br>

## Next Steps: 

This tool will use geospatial analysis to identify locations for sustainable material recovery, optimal routes for collection, and the best sites for new recycling infrastructure determining:

🔹 Where are critical minerals in high abundance?<br>
🔹 What are the most efficient way to reclaim them at scale?<br>
🔹 Include a Dockerfile and some sample inputs files for demos

💡 Ideal outcome: Build a mapping tool that visualizes locations to support circular economy planning with infrastructure siting and geospatial insights.
