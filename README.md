# 🌊 Geographic Information Systems Calculator

## Current Progress:

Write a Python script which will take as input the paths to an arbitrary raster (GeoTIFF) and vector polygon (Shapefile, GeoJSON or KML) and return the average value of cells within the bounds of the polygon.

A raster file of a Landsat8 scene for Band 5 (NIR) were demoed. 

Explored the raster file data and metadata taking note of what transformations might be required during the task.

## Bottom line: 

This tool will use geospatial analysis to identify hotspots for sustainable material recovery, optimal routes for collection, and the best sites for new recycling infrastructure determining:

🔹 Where are biomass-rich waste streams currently concentrated?<br>
🔹 What are the most efficient logistics pathways to move biomass to recycling hubs?<br>
🔹 How can insights from spatial data inform policy, investment, or public programs to boost recovery?<br>
🔹 Include a Dockerfile and some sample inputs files for demos

💡 Ideal outcome: Build a mapping tool that visualizes biomass locations to support smarter, more equitable circular economy planning—from infrastructure siting to programs designed around geospatial insights.

 ✅ Software-Driven – data analysis, models, data tools

 🎯 This project will blend disciplines—e.g., using real data + GIS + Engineering ideas—to deliver real-world, scalable impact.
