# 🌊 GIS Sustainable Materials: Calculator

This tool uses geospatial analysis to identify hotspots for critical mineral recovery, optimal routes for collection, and the best sites for new recycling infrastructure.

🔹 Where are biomass-rich waste streams currently concentrated?<br>
🔹 What are the most efficient logistics pathways to move biomass to recycling hubs?<br>
🔹 How can insights from spatial data inform policy, investment, or public programs to boost recovery?

💡 Goal: Build a mapping tool that visualizes biomass locations to support smarter, more equitable circular economy planning—from infrastructure siting to programs designed around geospatial insights.

 ✅ Software-Driven – data analysis, models, data tools

 🎯 This project will blend disciplines—e.g., using real data + GIS + Engineering ideas—to deliver real-world, scalable impact.
